# Steane-and-Shor-code-comparison
This repository contains the Steane and Shor code comparison for Quantum error correction.
Steane and Shor codes are renowned codes for quantum error correction.This repository contains the code that compares between these two error correcting algorithms and plots the graph of their logical failure rate vs Probability of error.
